## Available Scripts

### Development
```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm test           # Run tests
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 3000 already in use**
   - The app will automatically try port 3001
   - Or manually specify: `PORT=3001 npm start`

2. **Dependencies not installing**
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

3. **App not loading**
   - Check console for errors (F12 in browser)
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Performance Notes
- The AI feedback simulation includes a 3-second delay to mimic real API processing
- In production, this would be replaced with actual OpenAI API calls
- The app is optimized for modern browsers and responsive design

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Enhancements
1. **Real AI Integration**: Replace mock feedback with OpenAI API
2. **User Authentication**: Add login/registration system
3. **Progress Tracking**: Save user essays and track improvement
4. **Advanced Feedback**: Add more detailed grammar and style analysis

### Future Features
1. **Gamification**: Add points, badges, and achievements
2. **Subscription System**: Implement payment integration
3. **Speaking Module**: Add CELPIP speaking practice
